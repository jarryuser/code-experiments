## Overview
This is the `calendar` project, part of the [code-experiments repository](https://github.com/jarryuser/code-experiments). It is a [brief description of what the project does, e.g., "web-based interactive calendar application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"]. This project demonstrates [key features or skills, e.g., "responsive design, date handling, and user interaction"].

## How to Download the Project
You can download only the `calendar` project folder without cloning the entire repository using one of the following methods.

### Option 1: Using Git Sparse Checkout (Recommended for Developers)
This method downloads only the `calendar` folder while preserving Git functionality. Requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to be installed.

```bash
mkdir calendar-project && cd calendar-project
git init -q
git remote add origin https://github.com/jarryuser/code-experiments.git
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set calendar
git pull origin main
```

**Installation**:
- Linux: `sudo apt install git`
- macOS: `brew install git`
- Windows: Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

**Result**: The `calendar` folder will be downloaded to the `calendar-project` directory.

### Option 2: Using DownGit (Alternative for Non-Developers)
This method downloads the `calendar` folder as a ZIP archive using [DownGit](https://minhask.github.io/DownGit/). Requires `curl` or `wget` (pre-installed on most Linux/macOS systems; for Windows, use Git Bash, WSL, or Cygwin).

Using `curl`:
```bash
curl -L "https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/jarryuser/code-experiments/tree/main/calendar" -o calendar.zip
unzip calendar.zip
```

Using `wget`:
```bash
wget "https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/jarryuser/code-experiments/tree/main/calendar" -O calendar.zip
unzip calendar.zip
```

**Result**: The `calendar` folder will be extracted from the ZIP archive.

## Installation
